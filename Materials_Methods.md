The H.glycines genome was assembled from xx pacbio subreads using falcon.  An assembly of xx contigs was reduced to 1544 contigs using falcon-unzip.  These contigs were scaffolded to 590 scaffolds using chicago and Hi-C reads at Dovetail Genomics. This assembly was further scaffolded to 396 scaffolds using PacBio subreads and Sspace-longread v1.1. Gaps in the assembly were filled with PacBio CCS reads using Gm_closer v1.6.2.  Polishing, gap-filling, and local misassembly fixes were applied with Pilon v1.22, using XX Million 150bp Illumina paired end reads.
